- Nice article in Techcrunch http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/11/legendary-productivity-and-the-fear-of-modern-programming/ (summary:  "After researching stories on and conducting in-depth interviews regarding seven programming pioneers, from computer scientist Donald Knuth to Linux’s Linus Torvalds, we uncover productivity patterns common to achieving greatness and pitfalls of which to steer clear: There’s never been a widely used programming tool that was created by just one lone wolf in a cave. Sure, Jeff Dean is the trailblazer of the famed distributed computing infrastructure upon which Google towers. Peter Norvig may be immediately associated with JSchema. David Heinemeier Hannson’s pride and joy is the Ruby on Rails framework. But each of these creators had support for their groundbreaking inventions. Teamwork is the foundation of an empire that lone wolves simply can’t sustain. It’s why Google, home of world-renowned engineers, doesn’t tolerate lone wolves on campus. It’s the antithesis of “Googliness,” and software development in general, for two core reasons. Interestingly enough, Knuth, Norvig, Dean, Pike, Torvalds, Thompson and Hansson have all at one point said they’re believers of having a strong mental model, focus and visualization. It’s all about the ability to see the solution before diving into the problem.")
